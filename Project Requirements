Final Project
GES 772
Geospatial Web Services and Interoperability
UMBC - Fall 2018
Dr. Luis Bermudez - bermud@umbc.edu
Description
The final project consists of developing a geospatial Web-based application.
Examples:
• Support tourist providing points of interest in New York
• Flood risk web application
Final project is 28% if final grade
Teams and roles
The students will form teams of 2-3 students. A team will work through the elements of researching,
proposing, designing, and implementing the application.
It is expected that each student will have worked at least 40 hours on the project itself over the course of
4+ weeks. The instructor will be available to provide further guidance on the right scoping of specific
proposed projects.
Data source
For the source of data, students will use services found on the Web, including those used in labs
exercises. Students are required to setup their own services and a client.
Requirements (total 10 points)
• Designing of the system using Viewpoints (2 points).
• The students will provide at least one of those source via a web service (2 points).
• The students will develop a client application that:
• displays data from 3 sources of data via web services. One should be vector data (3
points).
• provides a faceted search with at least three different facets based on properties of the
vector data (2 points)
• provides and an event mouse functionality (1 points).
Proposal
• Provides the view points
• identifies sources of data and which ones will be hosted
• identifies the event mouse functionality interaction
• identifies the faceted search categories
